## 📝 **What is this?**
Welcome to **The Flying Poopman!**, a simple yet *addictively frustrating* game inspired by everyone's favorite "birdie" experience... but with a twist. Instead of a bird, you guide a **flying poopman** through deadly green pipes. Yes, you heard it right – **poopman**.  

Test your reflexes, rack up high scores, and **humble yourself** as you repeatedly crash into pipes like a majestic failure.
